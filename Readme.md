This is a preliminary readme file.

It will be replaced when Kingdom-Assignment, Kingdom-Splitter and Kingdom-Extraction are completely merged into one project.

Right now, see the Readmes for the individual executables for more
information:

- [Kingdom-Assignment](https://github.com/PalMuc/Kingdom-Assignment/blob/master/Kingdom-Assignment-Readme.md)
- [Kingdom-Splitter](https://github.com/PalMuc/Kingdom-Assignment/blob/master/Kingdom-Splitter-Readme.md)
- [Kingdom-Extraction](https://github.com/PalMuc/Kingdom-Assignment/blob/master/Kingdom-Extraction-Readme.md)
 
 Right now, this project should compile just fine. However, if you
 want a more thoroughly tested version, you should check out the ["old"
 branch](https://github.com/PalMuc/Kingdom-Assignment/tree/old) of this project
